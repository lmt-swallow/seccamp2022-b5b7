Given all sources including dependency definitions are trusted, we can move on to the next step --- build. Let's look back at [../02-towards-trustful-chains](../02-towards-trustful-chains):

> Even if we succeed in depending on only trustworthy artifacts, we still need to ensure what we're depending on are _what we decided to trust at the point in time_. At least we need to:
>
> - **Define dependencies statically to lock them (like `go.sum`)**
> - **Use locked dependencies following the definition properly**
>
> Another challenge is that compiled binaries or containers often lack information on what it is depending on internally, resulting in operation challenges. Suppose that you see a news that a researcher found that `package-blah-blah` had included malwares. Once you forget what kind of tools and packages container images depends on, you'll give a big sigh and lose time. This is one of the reasons why we need to have Software Bill of Materials (SBoM).

In this chapter, you'll try to build the following while generating SBoMs:

- Exercise 1: a Go app container image
- Exercise 2: an Alpine-based container image

## Preliminaries

Run the following commands to install requirements:

```sh
go install github.com/google/ko@v0.11.2
```

## Exercise 1: Build a Container Image with a Go Application Using `ko`

### Build

Run the following to build a Go image:

```sh
$ pushd ./ko-src; KO_DOCKER_REPO=ttl.sh ko build ./; popd

### Review SBoM

`ko` generates a SBoM with a container image and push it to the same OCI registry. You'll see the following line in the logs above:

```sh
2022/08/11 09:04:20 ttl.sh/<redacted>.sbom: digest: <snipped>
```

Let's check what it includes. Run the following command after replacing `<redacted>`:

```sh
crane blob ttl.sh/<redacted>.sbom@$(crane manifest ttl.sh/<redacted>.sbom | jq -r ".layers[0].digest")
```

You'll get the following logs:

## Exercise 2: Build an Alpine-based Container Image Using `apko`

`apko` is a tool to build and publish OCI container images built from APK packages. For instance, the following commands generate a container image with SBoM:

```sh
# in fish
set IMAGE_NAME ttl.sh/(uuidgen | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]):4h
docker run -v "$PWD":/work distroless.dev/apko build apko-src/alpine-base.yaml $IMAGE_NAME apko-alpine.tar
crane push apko-alpine.tar $IMAGE_NAME

# in bash
IMAGE_NAME=ttl.sh/$(uuidgen | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]):4h
docker run -v "$PWD":/work distroless.dev/apko build apko-src/alpine-base.yaml $IMAGE_NAME apko-alpine.tar
docker load < apko-alpine.tar
```

After `apko` exit successfully, you'll find some files like `sbom-*` in your current directory. Check them out to see what they include.

## Exercise (Optional): Review other build tools

See other build tools like [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), [FOSSology](https://www.fossology.org/), [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort), etc.

# Fulcio

In this section, you'll interact with Fulcio and Rekor by a small Python script. This kind of interaction is tricky a little bit --- in general, you won't talk with them directly and use wrappers like Cosign or any other attestators.

## Play with Fulcio

Where you should start is installation of requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed all requirements successfully, you can get a cert for an ephemeral key from Fulcio as follows:

```sh
python get_cert.py test
```

To see the content of the cert, use `openssl` as follows:

```sh
# Check the issued certificate
openssl x509 -in test.crt -text
```
